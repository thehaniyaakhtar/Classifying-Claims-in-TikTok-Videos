## 📌 Project Title

**Classifying Claims in TikTok Videos: An Exploratory Data Analysis Approach**

---

## 📁 Overview

This project explores the relationship between different types of claims made in TikTok videos and how they influence user engagement (likes, shares, views). The goal is to lay the foundation for a future machine learning model that can automatically classify claims and identify potential misinformation or trending content themes.

---

## 🎯 Business Use Case

Social media platforms like TikTok need scalable ways to detect and categorize claims in user content. This helps with content moderation, identifying trending topics, and ensuring compliance with misinformation policies. This project simulates the early analytical stages of such a system.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

* **Python**

  * `pandas`, `numpy` – data wrangling and feature engineering
  * `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – data visualization
  * `scipy.stats` – statistical tests
  * `sklearn` – regression modeling and encoding

---

## 🧪 Project Steps

### 1. Define the Problem (PACE Framework)

* What kinds of claims are users making?
* Do some claim types generate more engagement?

### 2. Data Preparation

* Cleaned raw TikTok data
* Created new features: word count, keyword presence, claim categories

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis

* Bar plots for claim distribution
* Correlation heatmaps of engagement metrics
* Pivot tables for average engagement by claim type

### 4. Statistical Testing

* Chi-square tests for independence (claim vs engagement)
* Correlation analysis between numeric features

### 5. Modeling for Insight

* Linear/logistic regression models
* Categorical encoding and assumption testing
* Interpreted features driving engagement

---

## 📈 Key Findings

* Claims related to health and finance attracted more engagement
* Statistical evidence supports correlation between claim type and virality
* Regression models showed how content features impact reach

---

## ✅ Outcome

Prepared a clean, structured dataset with engineered features and actionable insights. This analysis can serve as the groundwork for a machine learning classifier to detect claim types in TikTok videos.
